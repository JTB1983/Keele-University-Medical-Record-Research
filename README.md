MIDAS Research Project

Project summary:   

Reducing the burden of common musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and addressing NHS priorities requires better integration of data upstream of hospital care. Meaningful data collected from population level surveys, primary care electronic health records (EHR) and MSK community service providers have not been co-ordinated and linked together to inform public health and primary care policy making. In this project, we seek to overcome these barriers by developing a novel and scalable approach within North Staffordshire & Stoke-on-Trent (population â‰ˆ 483,000).  

The SNOMED CT code list created to identify potential patients contains 497 SNOMED Concept IDs which cover codes identified in the CPRD AURUM database with a prevalance of 0.5/10,000 or more between 2014 and 2019.
